/*
  Simple example as note to self on how to use
 writeMicroseconds(..); of the Servo Library
 
 Another copy of the default Arduino Servo example
 with an analog sensor (preferably a poti) on pin A0.

 Using microSeconds the resolution if far more
 than 180Â°. This way the motion can get much smoother.

 Change the start and end values according
 to your servos! They are most likely not always
 the same.
