/*
  Simple example as note to self on how to use
 writeMicroseconds(..); of the Servo Library
 
 This shows a continious sweep from one end
 to the other, as the default example does too.
 
 Using microSeconds the resolution if far more
 than 180Â°. This way the motion can get much smoother.
 
 Change the start and end values according
 to your servos! They are most likely not always
 the same.
